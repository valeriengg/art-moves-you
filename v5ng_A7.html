    <h1>Art That Moves You </h1>
     <h2> Artist <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annalaura_art">@annalaura_art</a> </h2>
       <p> Art is a true example of subjectiveness. An artist's interpretation of their 
       own art can widely differ from their audience's. Recently, I came across the 
       account <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annalaura_art">@annalaura_art</a> on
       tiktok. She specializes in comic strips and cartoonish animals, and her most recent 
       posts feature short clips of a comic that tells sweet stories of her characters. 
       Watching her tiktoks made me realize how art can truly influence or motivate their 
       audience. While her creations affected me strongly, they might be something 
       completely bland to another viewer. 
     <h2> Viewer Statistics </h2>
       <p> Anna-Laura seems to have several different social media platforms but let's 
       focus on her tiktok. Here are some of her top numbers/viewer statistics on tiktok 
       as of March 23, 2022.

             </ul>
        </ul>
      <p> Those are her top three videos which show quite a large reach in audience.
      While I did say art is subjective, hopefully you were also able to feel some emotions
      and warmth stirring from watching those tiktoks&excl; &#x263a; 
    <h2> Her Socials</h2>
      <p> Anna-Laura has quite a few platforms accessible by her <a href="linktr.ee/asulli23">linktree</a>,
      but here are some of those laid out for even easier access.

    <h2> Different Art Mediums </h2>
      <p> Just from taking a glance at her profiles, you can tell her favourite medium of 
      art is watercolour. However, that is not the only form of art she likes to create 
      with. Here is a list of the different medias of art Anna-Laura uses:
      <ol> 
        <li> Watercolour
        <li> Digital art
        <li> Marker ink
        <li> Oil pastels
        <li> Coffee spills
        <li> Pencil sketch
      </ol>
      <p> It's so interesting that she can create art with so many different mediums, 
      especially coffee stains! In this <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annalaura_art/video/6957831550377528582?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1">tiktok</a>,
      she pours coffee and draws defining lines with her blank ink marker throughout the 
      spill to create a beautiful piece. Her art resonates with many followers, and in a 
      post on Instagram, she mentions in the caption to <em>be patient</em> as you are still 
      growing. This can be applied to many situations but with the context of the post, it
      seems she is encouraging followers to be patient with their art or any struggles 
      they currently experience. 
      <p> Hopefully, you were able to find some tiktoks to connect with and share the warmth 
      with other viewers. My favourite tiktok of hers wasn't linked within this post so 
      maybe we'll have the same favourite! &#x1f609;
